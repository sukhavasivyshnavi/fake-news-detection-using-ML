# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting and classifying news articles as either real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a supervised machine learning algorithm. It addresses the growing challenge of online misinformation by automating the identification of fake news.

---

## Objective

To build a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts the authenticity of a news article based on its textual content.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries and Tools:**  
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - matplotlib  
  - seaborn  
  - scikit-learn  
- **NLP Technique:** CountVectorizer  
- **ML Algorithm:** PassiveAggressiveClassifier  

---

## Features

- Load and inspect labeled fake/real news articles  
- Perform text cleaning and preprocessing  
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Convert textual data into numerical form using CountVectorizer  
- Train a machine learning classification model  
- Evaluate model performance  
- Save the trained model and run predictions on new data
